I have worked as a developer for 10 years. 10 year may be not a very long time for a whole life, but it is also not a short period for career. As the time of 2014 is going away, 2015 is coming, I think it's time for me to look back and to write something to memorize the passed days.

I will choose some topics which are important in my past working days and share them in upcoming blogs

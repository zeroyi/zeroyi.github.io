When I first worked as a developer, Java is my first programming language. What is my IDE? Most of Java developer must use Eclipse as their favourite Java IDE at that time. However, at that time, the company I worked in used another IDE: Intellij IDEA.

## Intellij IDEA
Intellij IDEA, later, I will just call it IDEA, is one of products of Jetbrains which is a Czech company. At first I touch the IDE, I do not have too much concern about it since I am just a newbie at that time. However, gradually, I was attracted by it and felt its power and amazing. By now, I almost never program without it. I will list some points that worthy to speak out.

### File editor
As as IDE, the editor is one of most fundamental functionality. IDEA has abundant functions of editor. Some of them are usual operations which exist in other editors, some of them are unique. Below are list of them:
* Select word/sentence(Ctrl-W)
* Remove one line (Ctrl-Y)
* Duplicated one line (Ctrl-D)
* Find class (Ctrl-N)
* Find file (Ctrl-Shift-N)
* Find method (Ctrl-Alt-Shift-N)
* Find in path (Ctrl-Shift-F)

### Shortcut
If you're a person that continually pursuing efficiency of development, shortcut will be your favorites.

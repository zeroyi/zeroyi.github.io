After waking in the morning of new year, I have been shocked by a tragedy news: 35 people were dead in stampede for
celebration of New Year's Eve at the Bund in Shanghai. 
It should be a happy time for them, but becomes a grieved moment. The 35 people lost the chance to see the sunrising of 2015, although they may have a great plan for it.
Life is precious, but is fragile. May everyone has a safe and peaceful year in 2015. May the tragedy won't happen again.
